Hi

In this project i focused on creating database with some school data.

At the beginning i created tables such as: students, teachers and subject grades.
Based on these tables i resolved few exercises.

Tables difficulties: 
-Each table has to have at least one column which can be used to connect this table to others.
-Each column has to have appropriate data type.
-Creating big, random database; i used Python to resolve this problem.

If you have any question do not hesitate to conntact me: arkadiszszymondrag@gmail.com


PS. New exercises will be added regularly
